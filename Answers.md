1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
- RDBMS is the system that contains all the records of the database and you can create, read, add, update and delete recrods in this system.
- SQL is the language used to interact with this system.

1. Why do tables need a `primary key`?
- it's a record specifically designated to uniquely identify any records on that table.
1. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
- foreign key
1. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
- we need a third table that holds the foreign keys that references the primary keys of each table that holds the many to many relationships.
